                        Abstract: Misinformation makes democratic governance harder, especially in developing countries. 
                        Despite its real-world import, little is known about how to combat fake news outside of the U.S., 
                        particularly in places with low education, accelerating Internet access, and encrypted information sharing. 
                        This study uses a field experiment in India to test the efficacy of a pedagogical intervention on respondents' 
                        ability to identify fake news during the 2019 elections (N=1224). Treated respondents received in-person 
                        media literacy training in which enumerators demonstrated two tools to identify fake news: reverse image 
                        searching and navigating a fact-checking website. Receiving this hour-long media literacy intervention 
                        did not significantly increase respondents' ability to identify fake news on average. However, treated 
                        respondents who support the ruling party became significantly less able to identify pro-attitudinal fake news. 
                        These findings point to the resilience of misinformation in India and the presence of motivated reasoning in a 
                        traditionally non-ideological party system.

                        Abstract: Misinformation on encrypted messaging applications is linked to changes in public opinion, 
                        electoral outcomes, and even violence. Since encrypted platforms cannot control content, can social media users 
                        correct their peers' misperceptions? If so, how? We experimentally evaluate the effect of different types of 
                        corrective messages on the persistence of seven common rumors among a large sample of social media users in 
                        India (N=5104). We show that peer-to-peer corrections substantially reduce belief in misinformation. Neither 
                        motivated reasoning nor the sophistication of these corrective messages conditions their effects. Brief, unsourced 
                        and unsubstantiated corrections achieve an effect comparable to that of corrections backed by evidence from 
                        credible sources (domain experts and specialized fact-checkers alike). This suggests that merely signaling a 
                        doubt about a rumor (regardless of how substantiated this signal is) may go a long way in reducing 
                        misinformation. These results have implications for both users and platforms.

                        Abstract: Misinformation related to COVID-19 is rampant. While false stories of miracle  
                        cures might lead people to resist evidence-based policies such as hand washing,  
                        rumors that scapegoat minorities have the potential to fuel communal hatred  
                        and polarization. These problems are more pronounced in countries with low  
                        digital literacy, reliance on traditional medicine, but increasing social polarization. 
                        How can we correct misinformed beliefs during crises, especially when they are rooted in tradition and social identities?   
                        In this study, we use an experiment to evaluate a targeted correction strategy to reduce COVID-19 
                        misinformation in India (N=1250). We posit that belief in misinformation arises from pressures to
                        conform to the ingroup and from dissonance between priors and new information. Our experiment tests whether corrections 
                        that appeal to ingroup identities can reduce this dissonance, thereby attenuating the uptake of 
                        misinformation in group settings. This work offers insights for researchers, policymakers and tech platforms 
                        on avenues to combat harmful COVID-19 and health misinformation in developing countries.

                        <br>
                        The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the partisan polarization of
                        the American electorate. However scholarly investigation of this topic has conspicuously
                        understudied polarization in developing democracies. In this study I test the effect that
                        media source has on perceived credibility of information using two survey experiments and analyze whether partisan
                        identity and polarization affect information consumption. Data comes from an orginal survey of 7,000 households
                        across 4 states in India.

                       Sociologists and political scientists have demonstrated a link between offspring
                       gender and parental beliefs and voting habits by demonstrating that parenting
                        daughters increases liberal attitudes. We test this hypothesis in the context of
                        urban India using a novel identification strategy that exploits the gender of one's first born child in India as random.
                        We hypothesize that having a girl child first leads to a shift in respondent attitudes in the liberal direction. The 
                        paper utilizes original data from a representative survey of 5400 urban households in the National Capital Region of India.
