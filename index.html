                        <br>
                        This study tests the efficacy of a persuasive fact-checking intervention on ability to identify fake news during 
                        the 2019 elections in India, using a field experiment with 1200 respondents in Bihar. 
                        The study seeks to understand whether in-person fact-checking interventions increase ability to 
                        identify fake news, what kinds of misinformation are more resistant to corrections, and whether 
                        motivated reasoning affects partisans' responses.

                        <br>
                        The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the partisan polarization of
                        the American electorate. However scholarly investigation of this topic has conspicuously
                        understudied polarization in developing democracies. In this study I test the effect that
                        media source has on perceived credibility of information using two survey experiments and analyze whether partisan
                        identity and polarization affect information consumption. Data comes from an orginal survey of 7,000 households
                        across 4 states in India.

                       In this paper, we analyze preferences among women who are currently unemployed to
                       enter the labor force through a survey experiment in the vicinity of the Indian cities of Patna
                       and Varanasi. Our results are striking – women are 14 to 22 percentage points less likely
                       to express a preference to take up a suitable job if they have to travel one hour to work.
                       The magnitude of these effects are far greater than the impact of the primary wage earner
                       of the household losing his/her job. This suggests that the impact of the lack of safe mobility for women on
                       preferences to enter the labor market may be more severe than is commonly assumed, even
                       more than income effects and lack of assistance at home – the major economic explanations
                       for why women choose to leave the labor force.

                       Sociologists and political scientists have demonstrated a link between offspring
                       gender and parental beliefs and voting habits by demonstrating that parenting
                        daughters increases liberal attitudes. We test this hypothesis in the context of
                        urban India using a novel identification strategy that exploits the gender of one's first born child in India as random.
                        We hypothesize that having a girl child first leads to a shift in respondent attitudes in the liberal direction. The 
                        paper utilizes original data from a representative survey of 5400 urban households in the National Capital Region of India.
